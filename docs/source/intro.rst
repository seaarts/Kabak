Introduction
============

``Kabak`` is a collection of common covering and packing models and algorithms.


Motivation
**********

Covering and packing problems are linear (integer) programs with specific structure. While there are many powerful general IP/LP solvers, there are not many that explicitly exploit the structure of particular covering / packing problems. Moreover, there are many interesting covering and packing algorithms that are usueful to have implemented.

Limitations
***********
Kabak is written in Python and might not be the fastest possible. But at least it exists.

While making code good as possible is the goal, one must also be forgiving.

    You can make any ship you want! But... even if the ship kills someone or destroys the world...
    A creator must never disown a ship he designed!"
